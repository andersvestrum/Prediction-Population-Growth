# Prediction-Population-Growth

Project Description: For our project, we plan to explore what factors best predict a country’s population growth. This will involve using a historical global population dataset that contains additional socioeconomic indicators like GDP per capita, life expectancy, development indices, and demographic features. This topic is relevant to a wide variety of stakeholders, including governments planning resource allocation, economists studying the progression of populations and development, and international organizations analyzing global trends. These predictions support market sizing, demand forecasting, and investment strategy. Businesses can use them to spot emerging markets, plan expansion, optimize supply chains, and identify regions with growing labor forces or consumer bases. Because population growth is influenced by several complex, nonlinear factors, machine learning would provide an ideal approach to this project. Machine learning models can capture these relationships much better than traditional linear models, as well as manage high-dimensional data, which would offer insights that can benefit all stakeholders involved.
